- use artboard with option x:0 y:0 --> no transform property in export
- export as... svg (with "use artboards" checked) (with object ids - layer names)
- optimize in SVGOMG
- use ids to add as many styles and attributes, so after a new export you can just copy paste and don't rely on manually added classes
